# ShoppingSimulator
This program will run the user through a store in which they are able to add or delete items to a cart, view the items in the cart, and proceed to checkout. The user may pay with card or cash. If they pay with card, a receipt of the purchase will be displayed. If they pay with cash, it will count the denominations that are due to the customer and then display a receipt for their order.
